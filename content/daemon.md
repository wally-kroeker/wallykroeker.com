[ABOUT]

My name is Wally Kroeker and I'm a Technical Architect and Security Consultant based in Winnipeg, Canada.

I've spent 15+ years building infrastructure, designing security systems, and helping organizations adopt technology pragmatically. My work bridges three domains that rarely overlap: infrastructure operations, security architecture, and AI adoption strategy.

I have ADHD, which shapes how I build systems: low friction, high automation, externalized memory, minimal cognitive overhead. I work with an AI assistant named Bob (built on Personal AI Infrastructure) who helps me stay focused, manage tasks, and ship work consistently.

[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Winnipeg, Canada

[MISSION]

Help technical teams adopt AI safely and effectively. Build systems that reduce cognitive overhead and enable human flourishing. Demonstrate enterprise-grade patterns at home-lab scale so others can learn and adapt.

[AI_PARTNERSHIP]

I work with an AI assistant named Bob, built on the Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI) framework. Our partnership is designed for:

- ADHD support: Task initiation, time management, gentle accountability
- Technical collaboration: Code review, architecture discussions, documentation
- Daily operations: Task management via Vikunja, financial tracking via Firefly III
- Building in public: Bob helps me ship consistently and document as I go

Bob runs on Claude Code with custom skills, hooks, and MCP integrations. The entire system is open-source at github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my framework for tracking purpose and direction. It documents Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, and Goals to achieve.

Problems:
- P1: Technical teams struggle to adopt AI safely without proper guardrails
- P2: ADHD makes traditional productivity systems fail; we need different approaches
- P3: Infrastructure knowledge is siloed; patterns should be shared openly

Missions:
- M1: Provide security-first AI consulting through GoodFields
- M2: Build and share ADHD-optimized AI workflows through Bob/PAI
- M3: Document enterprise patterns at home-lab scale through FabLab

[PROJECTS]

- GoodFields Consulting: AI security and infrastructure consulting for technical teams
- FabLab: Enterprise-grade home lab infrastructure (Proxmox, containers, IdP, networking)
- Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI): ADHD-optimized AI assistant framework
- wallykroeker.com: Personal site built in public with transparent build logs
- Cognitive Loop: Daily writing practice exploring AI, resilience, and being human

[PREFERENCES]

- Writing tools: Cursor IDE with Claude, Neovim for quick edits
- Programming: TypeScript, Python, Go
- Operating system: Linux (WSL2 + Ubuntu), occasional macOS
- AI models: Claude (primary), Gemini for research, local models for testing
- Infrastructure: Proxmox, Docker, Cloudflare Tunnels, Authentik
- Task management: Vikunja with AI integration
- Communication: Direct, honest, async-preferred
- Work style: Deep focus blocks, heavy automation, externalized memory
- Values: Openness, usefulness, security-first, community over competition

[DAILY_ROUTINE]

- Morning: Review overnight AI task completions, process Vikunja inbox
- Focus blocks: Deep work on consulting or projects (Bob manages task switching)
- Afternoon: Client calls, community engagement, documentation
- Evening: Cognitive Loop writing, reading, low-stakes experimentation
- Throughout: Bob provides gentle nudges for time management and task completion

[PREDICTIONS]

- AI assistants will become standard tooling for knowledge workers by 2027 (Almost Certain)
- Personal daemons/APIs will enable new forms of human networking (Probable)
- ADHD-optimized AI workflows will become a recognized category (Probable)
- Security-first AI adoption will differentiate successful enterprises (Almost Certain)
- Open-source AI infrastructure will mature rapidly (Almost Certain)
- Human-AI partnerships will be measured and optimized like other productivity metrics (Probable)
