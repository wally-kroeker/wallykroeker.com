## Today I worked on

- **publishing-loop** — Complete infrastructure for Git-first publishing system with project hubs and timelines

## Highlights

- Fixed "Invalid Date" bug by converting legacy frontmatter to YAML
- Built timeline system that merges blog posts + build log milestones
- Created filtering gates (status/reviewed/sensitivity) for draft control
- Implemented first project hub at `/projects/publishing-loop`

## Changelog

**publishing-loop**

- fix(content): convert building post to proper YAML frontmatter
- feat(lib): extend PostMeta with publishing gates and project fields
- feat(lib): add isPublic() filtering helper with backward compatibility
- feat(blog): filter posts using isPublic() gate
- feat(lib): add H2 section parsing and getAllPosts helper
- feat(lib): create projectUpdates with timeline aggregation logic
- feat(app): create /projects/[slug] route with timeline UI
- content(projects): add publishing-loop project hub and initial milestone

## Decisions

- Keep `/guides` for standalone tutorials, `/projects` for living build logs
- Use three-gate system: all of `status:published`, `reviewed:true`, `sensitivity:public` required
- Default missing fields to published/public for backward compatibility
- Parse H2 sections from build-log.md as milestone entries

## Next steps

- Test the timeline at `/projects/publishing-loop`
- Verify filtering hides draft content correctly
- Document schema in CLAUDE.md for global agent awareness
- Create `.publishing-config.json` for n8n to know which repos to scan
- Update global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so agent knows about system from any project
