# Editorial Review: "2025 Wasn't the Year of the Agent"

**Reviewer**: Bob (acting as editor)
**Date**: Dec 26, 2025
**Article Version**: Draft-2025-Year-of-the-agent-v3.md

## Overall Assessment

**VOICE CHECK**: ✅ This is authentically you. Conversational, grounded in real experience, technical without being jargon-heavy. The "greybeard practitioner who's been here before" voice lands consistently throughout.

**STRUCTURE**: Strong. The arc works:
- Origin story (personal, relatable)
- Reality check (data-backed)
- Where it works (your experience)
- Security/privacy (your expertise)
- Conclusion + GBAIC invitation

**READABILITY**: Excellent. Varied sentence length, good use of bullet points and blockquotes for emphasis. Scannable for busy readers.

**STRATEGIC FIT**: Perfect positioning for GoodFields - demonstrates expertise, shows you're building in public, invites peer conversation rather than client pitching.

## Issues to Fix

### CRITICAL (must fix before publishing)

1. **Line 329**: Orphaned "s" character - delete this
   ```
   ---
   s          ← DELETE THIS LINE
   ## Sources
   ```

### TONE DECISIONS (your call)

2. **Line 207**: "(that sounds dirty lol)"
   - **Context**: "about a third saw agents touch sensitive data inappropriately (that sounds dirty lol)"
   - **Editor note**: This is peak Wally voice - self-aware humor breaking up heavy technical content
   - **Options**:
     - Keep it (leans into conversational authenticity, signals "I'm a human not a corporate blog")
     - Remove it (stays professional without losing impact)
     - Rephrase: "...inappropriately - yes, that phrasing is unfortunate, but it's what the survey said."
   - **My recommendation**: Keep it. It's a 3-second smile in a dense article. Your audience will appreciate the humanity.

3. **Line 71**: "beleive" → should be "believe"
   - **Context**: "reality of agents is not a rosy as the headlines lead us to beleive"
   - **Also**: "a rosy" → "as rosy"
   - **Fix**: "reality of agents is not as rosy as the headlines lead us to believe"

## Strengths (don't change these)

### Voice Wins
- "The kind who've been through enough hype cycles to know the difference between demos and 3am pages" (line 9) - PERFECT greybeard positioning
- "That's not just marketing spin - it's the industry subconsciously admitting..." (line 78) - calling out the pattern
- "The promise of infrastructure-as-code has always been hampered by the learning curve..." (line 176) - you're naming the pain
- "Treat agents as syntax accelerators and documentation engines" (line 181) - actionable, specific, honest

### Data Integration
You weave stats naturally without drowning the reader. The 80%/95%/70%/96% sequence (lines 51-58) lands hard because you set it up with "When you look past vendor decks and into production surveys..."

### The GBAIC Introduction
The origin story (lines 7-22) earns the GBAIC pitch at the end. You're not selling a product - you're documenting a real conversation that led to a real need. This is how thought leadership should work.

### Security Section Authority
Lines 186-226 show your expertise without flexing. You:
- Explain your own choices (trusting Anthropic)
- Give practical controls (least privilege, segmentation, auditability)
- Acknowledge when local models make sense
This is consultant positioning gold.

## Structural Notes

### Pacing
- First 1/3 (lines 1-83): Sets up the problem - tight, data-heavy, well-sourced
- Middle 1/3 (lines 84-184): Your experience - FabLab, infrastructure wins, Excel wizard analogy
- Final 1/3 (lines 185-346): Security, progress acknowledgment, GBAIC invitation

This rhythm works. Reader gets credibility → relatability → invitation.

### The "Frustrated? You're Doing It Right" Section (lines 263-281)
This might be the most valuable section for your audience. It reframes failure as productive learning. Consider highlighting this quote more prominently (maybe pull it out as a callout/aside in the blog design).

## Headline Thoughts

Current: "2025 Wasn't the 'Year of the Agent' - It Was the Year We Found the Edges"

**Strengths**:
- Subverts expectation
- "Found the Edges" is evocative and true
- Sets up contrarian but honest take

**Alternative options** (if you want to test):
- "The Year of the Agent? More Like the Year We Found the Limits"
- "2025: When AI Agents Hit Production Reality"
- "What 2025 Actually Taught Us About AI Agents"

**My recommendation**: Keep your current headline. "Found the Edges" is more interesting than "Found the Limits" and positions you as explorer rather than critic.

## LinkedIn Teaser Strategy

The article is 3,400 words - too long for LinkedIn native posting. Strategy:

**Option A** (recommended):
- 300-400 word teaser on LinkedIn
- Link to full article on wallykroeker.com
- Maximizes website traffic, positions personal brand as hub

**Option B**:
- Post first ~600 words on LinkedIn as native article
- "Read the full piece at wallykroeker.com" link at natural break point
- Better engagement (LinkedIn algo favors native content) but splits traffic

**I'll draft Option A** (teaser + link) since that aligns with your Dec 24 strategy of wallykroeker.com as personal brand moat.

- [ ] Fix line 329 orphaned "s"

## Bottom Line

This article is **publication-ready** after fixing the 3 typos.

**Why it works**:
- Authentic voice (greybeard practitioner, not vendor pitching)
- Data-backed claims (8 cited sources, current research)
- Personal experience (FabLab examples ground abstract concepts)
- Actionable insights (infrastructure as sweet spot, security controls)
- Natural invitation (GBAIC feels earned, not forced)

**Strategic value for GoodFields**:
- Demonstrates expertise without selling
- Positions you as peer/guide to experienced practitioners
- Shows you're building in public (FabLab, Bob)
- Creates permission for inbound conversations

**This is the kind of content that makes people say**: "This person gets it. I want to talk to them."

Ship it.
