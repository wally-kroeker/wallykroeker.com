## 2025-11-28 — Initial Project Setup and Documentation

**Commit**: [`7f0e293`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/bob-and-friends/commit/7f0e293)

Created the foundational structure for the Bob and Friends multi-agent system, establishing the project architecture and comprehensive documentation. The system is inspired by Dennis E. Taylor's Bobiverse series, where the original Bob coordinates specialized clone agents for different mission types. Set up project directories (docs/, agents/, configs/, scripts/), documented detailed agent personas for all six team members (Bob as orchestrator, plus Bill/Mario/Riker/Howard/Homer as specialized clones), and defined strict security boundaries for cloud deployment to ATXP Cloud via Circuit & Chisel's platform. Created Riker (Researcher) configuration as the first deployment candidate due to research being naturally public-facing with lowest security risk. This infrastructure enables parallel task execution across specialized agents while maintaining sensitive data isolation, demonstrating multi-agent architecture expertise for GoodFields consulting engagements.
