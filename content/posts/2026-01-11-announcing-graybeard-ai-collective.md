If you've been working in IT for more than a decade, you've seen the hype cycles.

Virtualization was going to simplify everything. The cloud was going to eliminate your data center. Every new management platform promised to finally make Windows and Linux play nice together.

And now: AI is going to automate everything.

Here's what I've learned after 20+ years in the trenches: The hype is never the whole story. The vendors selling the dream aren't the ones doing the work. And the best knowledge doesn't come from "thought leaders." It comes from peers who actually built it.

That's why I'm launching the GrayBeard AI Collective.

## What This Is

A community for veteran infrastructure practitioners (10+ years) who are figuring out how AI is changing our work.

No vendor pitches. No courses to sell. No LinkedIn thought leadership energy.

Just honest, practitioner-level knowledge sharing about what's actually working, and what's not.

Monthly meetups (Discord voice, last Wednesday of each month, 7pm Central) where we:
- Share PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) systems we're building
- Demo tools and automation that actually work in production
- Talk about the gap between AI hype and operational reality
- Help each other solve real problems

Discord community for async discussion between meetups:
- Share architecture, tools, lessons learned
- Post in #show-and-tell when you build something interesting
- Ask questions without feeling like you're the only one who doesn't get it

Peer-to-peer format where everyone contributes. This isn't me lecturing at you. This is all of us figuring this out together.

## Why "GrayBeard"?

In Unix culture, a "graybeard" was the wizard in the basement. The one who actually knew how the systems worked, got paged at 2am, and remembered why that config file couldn't be changed.

Whether you came up through Windows Server, VMware, or old-school Unix, you've earned the gray. You've kept systems running that vendors said were impossible to maintain. You've migrated infrastructures while users kept working. You've been the institutional knowledge that kept 500-user shops, or 5,000-user enterprises, from falling over.

You've debugged production outages at 3am. You know when to say no, and when you can go fast and break things.

That knowledge is invaluable right now. AI is changing our work in ways that actually matter to us. Infrastructure as Code was always a thing, but for many of us it was inaccessible. We weren't programmers. AI has unlocked that. It's good at switch configs, at tracking changes, at keeping documentation current. All that IT debt that accumulates with every project? AI can finally help finish it off.

Here's what matters: AI doesn't know when a change will break production. *You do.* When a vendor says "AI will automate your entire infrastructure," you know to ask: *At what cost? What failure modes? What happens when the model hallucinates a firewall rule?*

Operational wisdom plus AI capability. That's the combination that matters.

## What I'm Sharing at the First Meetup

On Wednesday, January 28 at 7pm Central, I'm showing off Bob.

Bob is my AI business partner. He helps run GoodFields Consulting.

Bob handles:
- Infrastructure architecture decisions
- Business operations and planning
- Technical research and analysis
- Content generation and editing
- Git commits and code reviews

I'm not selling Bob as a product. I'm sharing what I built, how it works, the architecture behind it, what's working, what's still experimental, and what completely failed.

Then we'll have an open discussion: "What are you building?"

I want to hear about your PAI systems, your automation experiments, your AI tool stack, and what you're trying to figure out.

## Who Should Join

This collective is for you if:

- You've been doing infrastructure/ops/security for 10+ years
- You're experimenting with AI in your work (or want to start)
- You want to share what you're learning with peers who get it
- You're tired of vendor pitches and "AI thought leaders"
- You value honest conversation over polished marketing

This collective is NOT for:

- People trying to sell AI products or services
- Anyone whose LinkedIn bio includes "AI evangelist" or "disrupting [industry]"
- Anyone looking for an AI 101 intro. This isn't that.

## How to Join

Discord: https://discord.gg/Skn98TXg

First Meetup: Wednesday, January 28, 2026 @ 7pm Central (Discord voice)

Next Meeting After That: Last Wednesday of every month (Feb 25, Mar 26, etc.)

Introduce yourself in #general. Share your work in #show-and-tell. Join the voice meetup on Jan 28.

See you in Discord.

## About Me

I'm Wally Kroeker. 12 years building security and infrastructure for mid-sized enterprises. Now I run GoodFields Consulting, focusing on AI implementation and security.

I built Bob (my AI business partner) as an external cortex for ADHD executive function and a thinking partner for architecture decisions. Bob is part of my PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure): automation, knowledge management, voice integration, agent orchestration.

I'm sharing this because I think we're at the beginning of a shift in how infrastructure work gets done. I'd rather figure it out with peers than alone.

See you on January 28.

Wally
