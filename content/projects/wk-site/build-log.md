## 2025-10-16 — Dynamic Project Hubs

**Commit**: [`0cced06`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/0cced06)

Merged publishing-loop repository into main site codebase and implemented dynamic project hub pages. Each project now generates its own hub view with timeline, milestones, and build log entries. The consolidation simplifies deployment by eliminating the separate publishing-loop repo while maintaining all automation functionality. Project hubs pull from structured data files and render consistent navigation across the portfolio site.

## 2025-10-15 — Production Publishing System

**Commit**: [`d119418`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/d119418)

Finalized the automated publishing pipeline for production use. The system now runs reliably on a daily schedule, pulling commit data from multiple repositories and generating build log entries. Integrated WSL-based cron scheduling with N8N workflow automation to handle the daily rollup process. Added error handling and logging to track pipeline execution. This establishes the foundation for automated portfolio updates without manual intervention.

## 2025-10-15 — COMPASS Voice Alignment

**Commit**: [`80a2910`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/80a2910)

Refined the N8N daily overview prompt to match the tone and style defined in COMPASS.md. The AI-generated summaries now use plainspoken builder language focused on technical substance rather than marketing hype. Updated prompt engineering to emphasize clarity, directness, and relevance to technical decisions. This ensures consistency across all automated content generation and maintains the portfolio's authentic voice.

## 2025-10-15 — Project Timeline System

**Commit**: [`09e8c74`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/09e8c74)

Built the complete project hub and timeline rendering system. Projects display chronological milestone progressions with commit hashes, dates, and technical summaries. The timeline structure organizes work into digestible entries that show evolution over time. Implemented data schema for storing milestone information and template components for consistent display. This provides visitors clear visibility into project development history.

## 2025-10-20 — Publishing Loop Documentation

**Commit**: [`827e1c1`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/827e1c1)

Added comprehensive documentation for the publishing loop automation system that runs daily via WSL and N8N. The system handles automated rollup of daily activities and generates AI-powered summaries for the portfolio site. Documentation covers the technical workflow from data collection through summary generation and publishing. This establishes the foundation for automated content updates without manual intervention. The milestone entries track progress on timeline visualization and build log systems that showcase project evolution. Core infrastructure now supports continuous documentation of development work.

## 2025-10-20 — Publishing Loop Automation

**Commit**: [`4e755af`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/4e755af)

Integrated automation script that orchestrates daily publishing workflows using WSL and N8N. The system enables automated daily rollups of project activity and generates AI-powered summaries without manual intervention. Setup includes script integration for the publishing loop alongside cleanup of legacy automation code. This creates a foundation for consistent daily publishing cadence tied to build log and timeline systems. The automation bridges local development environment (WSL) with workflow orchestration (N8N) for reliable scheduled execution.

## 2025-10-21 — Bob/PAI Publishing Integration

**Commit**: [`0a51796`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/0a51796)

Connected the Bob project and its PAI foundation into the automated publishing loop. This enables daily rollup posts to automatically include updates from the skills-based architecture work happening in Bob. The integration required mapping Bob's milestone commits to the existing N8N workflow that generates daily summaries. This brings Bob development activity into the same visibility system as the main site work, making cross-project progress tracking more cohesive.

## 2025-10-21 — Bob/PAI Publishing Loop Integration

**Commit**: [`0a51796`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/0a51796)

Integrated the "Bob/PAI" project into the automated publishing loop for the main portfolio site. This connects the Bob repository to the central N8N workflow that monitors for new milestone commits. When a new milestone is detected, the workflow automatically pulls the commit data and generates a new build log entry on the site. This automation ensures the project's progress is continuously and accurately reflected on the live site. The integration required adding the new repository endpoint to the N8N configuration and updating the site's data models.

## 2025-10-20 — Publishing Loop Automation Script

**Commit**: [`4e755af`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/4e755af)

This commit introduces the core automation script for the "publishing loop" system. The script runs on a daily schedule within a WSL environment, orchestrated by an N8N workflow. It fetches recent milestone commits from all connected project repositories using the Git API. The script then formats this data into a structured JSON file that the static site generator consumes to build project timeline pages. This system removes the manual process of updating build logs and ensures the portfolio reflects development activity in near real-time.

## 2025-10-20 — Publishing Loop Documentation

**Commit**: [`827e1c1`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/827e1c1)

Added comprehensive documentation for the newly implemented publishing loop system. This documentation outlines the system's architecture, including the roles of WSL, N8N, and the static site generator. It details the process for connecting new projects to the loop and the specific commit message format required for a commit to be captured as a milestone. Initial milestone entries were also backfilled to populate the project timelines. This foundational documentation is crucial for maintaining and extending the automation system over time.
