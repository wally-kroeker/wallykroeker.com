# Build Log - January 20, 2026

## Afternoon Session (1:01 PM)

Spent the evening debugging why n8n workflow configuration instructions weren't working. Classic case of documentation describing UI elements incorrectly. I kept telling the user to 'select Expression from the dropdown' but Expression isn't a dropdown option - it's a toggle button at the top right of the field. Only discovered this when the user shared a screenshot showing the actual UI. The dropdown is for content type (JSON, Form Data, etc.) and the toggle switches between Fixed values and Expression mode. Once we saw the actual interface, everything clicked. Updated DEPLOY-NOW.md with the correct pattern: select JSON from dropdown, click Expression toggle, enter the expression. Also realized the Parse Message code in the live workflow was missing the notionPayload construction - it was old code that just returned basic fields. The correct code exists in parse-message-node-code.js but needs to be copied into the n8n UI. Bill had confirmed the approach was sound, but we were debugging the wrong thing until the screenshots showed the real issue.

## Afternoon Session (1:10 PM)

Wally opened a new project directory called TSFUR (The Search for Ultimate Reality) - an old Discord server name that he wanted to repurpose as a personal conversation space. Not for project work, but for philosophy, brain dumps, and staying accountable. The goal was to make it a place where I already know what's pressing in his life when he shows up. We designed a two-tier system: TSFUR for thinking and talking, project folders for doing and tracking. Created TSFUR/CLAUDE.md with a session start protocol that auto-loads his TELOS context (goals, projects, challenges) every time. Built out current-priorities.md that surfaces urgent items - Security Folk training deadlines, Red River Mutual job in reference check stage, Greybeard AI meetup coming up. Then we tackled the bigger pattern: standardized project structure. Used Security-Folk as the reference implementation. Created CLAUDE.md (project context and how I help), tasks.md (24 tracked tasks with states), and STATUS.md (quick reference for 'what do I work on today?'). The Security Folk stuff had gotten muddled - he thought he missed the Jan 17-18 session but actually it was cancelled due to winter storm and rescheduled to February. Updated everything to reflect the real timeline. The pattern is ADHD-aware: reduces activation energy, celebrates completion, no shame accountability. It's replicable across all his projects - GoodFields, FabLab, everything. TSFUR becomes home base for life conversations. Projects become execution spaces with clear task tracking. Clean separation between being and doing.

## Evening Session (5:23 PM)

Wally continued his security guard training with Module 5: Writing Notes and Reports. This is the kind of module where the details matter - these notes could literally be court evidence someday. I captured 1,868 lines of structured content across four main sections. First section covered note-taking fundamentals: the four writing factors (Audience, Purpose, Format, Voice), notebook format requirements (numbered pages, pen only, never erase), and the critical 5 W's and H framework. Added the 24-hour clock conversion rules and complete NATO phonetic alphabet since he'll need those for radio communication. Second section was report writing - routine versus incident reports, the three-stage writing process (before, during, after), and four contrasting example reports. The examples were instructive: Report #1 had too much irrelevant detail (meatloaf sandwich, complaints about equipment), Report #2 was too brief (missing critical descriptions), Report #3 was the gold standard (chronological, objective, complete), and the McClung High School report showed 13 common errors to avoid. Third section covered evidence types with reliability rankings - direct evidence most reliable (witnessed with your senses), circumstantial less so (broken window + bleeding hand nearby), hearsay least reliable (repeating what someone else said). Also documented crime scene protection procedures and chain of custody requirements. Fourth section was court testimony - subpoena is an ORDER not a request, 11 specific courtroom behavior rules (answer only what's asked, facts not opinions, equal respect for both lawyers). Created 61 flashcards organized by topic: 15 for note-taking, 12 for report writing, 10 for evidence, 8 for crime scene protection, 13 for court testimony. Updated the course overview to mark Module 5 complete - that's 5 out of 10 modules done (50%), with the January 31 exam deadline approaching. The flashcard total is now 135 across the three completed modules (22 from Law, 52 from Patrolling, 61 from this one). The pretest question asked if notebook notes could be used as court evidence - answered TRUE with full explanation of why proper format matters (numbered pages so they can't be removed undetected, pen not pencil, objective tone, within 24 hours). This is real-world training for a volunteer position at Winnipeg Folk Festival. The attention to detail here isn't academic - if something goes wrong at the festival and Wally has to testify about what he witnessed, these note-taking practices could be the difference between reliable testimony and inadmissible evidence.
