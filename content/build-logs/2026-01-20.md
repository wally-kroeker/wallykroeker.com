# Build Log - January 20, 2026

## Afternoon Session (1:01 PM)

Spent the evening debugging why n8n workflow configuration instructions weren't working. Classic case of documentation describing UI elements incorrectly. I kept telling the user to 'select Expression from the dropdown' but Expression isn't a dropdown option - it's a toggle button at the top right of the field. Only discovered this when the user shared a screenshot showing the actual UI. The dropdown is for content type (JSON, Form Data, etc.) and the toggle switches between Fixed values and Expression mode. Once we saw the actual interface, everything clicked. Updated DEPLOY-NOW.md with the correct pattern: select JSON from dropdown, click Expression toggle, enter the expression. Also realized the Parse Message code in the live workflow was missing the notionPayload construction - it was old code that just returned basic fields. The correct code exists in parse-message-node-code.js but needs to be copied into the n8n UI. Bill had confirmed the approach was sound, but we were debugging the wrong thing until the screenshots showed the real issue.
