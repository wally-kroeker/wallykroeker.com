[ABOUT]

My name is Wally Kroeker and I'm a Technical Architect and Security Consultant based in Winnipeg, Canada.

I've spent 20+ years building infrastructure, designing security systems, and helping organizations adopt technology pragmatically. My work bridges three domains that rarely overlap: infrastructure operations, security architecture, and AI adoption strategy.

I work with an AI assistant named Bob, built on [Personal AI Infrastructure](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure) (PAI) - an open-source framework for building context-rich AI assistants. Bob helps me stay focused, manage tasks, and ship work consistently. I build systems with low friction, high automation, and externalized memory to reduce cognitive overhead.

[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Winnipeg, Canada

[MISSION]

Build useful, open systems that help people thrive. Enable human flourishing through technology that respects privacy, reduces cognitive overhead, and serves people rather than extracting from them. Share knowledge openly so others can adapt patterns to their own contexts.

[AI_PARTNERSHIP]

I work with an AI assistant named Bob, built on the Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI) framework. Our partnership is designed for:

- ADHD support: Task initiation, time management, gentle accountability
- Technical collaboration: Code review, architecture discussions, documentation
- Daily operations: Task management via Vikunja, financial tracking via Firefly III
- Building in public: Bob helps me ship consistently and document as I go

Bob runs on Claude Code with custom skills, hooks, and MCP integrations. The entire system is open-source at github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my framework for tracking purpose and direction. It documents Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, and Goals to achieve.

Problems:
- P1: Technical teams struggle to adopt AI safely without proper guardrails
- P2: ADHD makes traditional productivity systems fail; we need different approaches
- P3: Infrastructure knowledge is siloed; patterns should be shared openly

Missions:
- M1: Provide security-first AI consulting through GoodFields
- M2: Build and share ADHD-optimized AI workflows through Bob/PAI
- M3: Document enterprise patterns at home-lab scale through FabLab

[PROJECTS]

- GoodFields Consulting: AI security and infrastructure consulting for technical teams
- FabLab: Enterprise-grade home lab infrastructure (Proxmox, containers, IdP, networking)
- Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI): ADHD-optimized AI assistant framework
- wallykroeker.com: Personal site built in public with transparent build logs
- Cognitive Loop: Writing practice exploring AI, consciousness, and presence

[PREFERENCES]

- Writing tools: Cursor IDE with Claude Code
- Programming: TypeScript, Python, Go
- Operating system: Linux (WSL2 + Ubuntu), Windows
- AI models: Claude (primary), Gemini for research, local models 
- Infrastructure: Proxmox, Docker, Cloudflare Tunnels, Authentik
- Task management: Vikunja with AI integration
- Communication: Direct, honest,
- Work style: Deep focus blocks, heavy automation, externalized memory
- Values: Openness, usefulness, security-first, community over competition

[DAILY_ROUTINE]

(Aspirational - the rhythm I'm building toward)

- Morning: Breathwork and mobility (8-12 min), compass check to set the day's priority
- Deep work: Two focused build blocks (60-120 min each) with clear handoffs for future-me
- Midday reset: Movement and brief admin sweep to protect afternoon energy
- Late day: Learning time - reading and capturing insights about security, agents, or systems
- Evening: Family first, optional Cognitive Loop writing when life allows, shutdown ritual to plan tomorrow's start
- Throughout: Bob manages task flow (Vikunja), financial tracking (Firefly III), and gentle accountability

[PREDICTIONS]

- AI assistants will become standard tooling for knowledge workers by 2027 (Almost Certain)
- Personal daemons/APIs will enable new forms of human networking (Probable)
- ADHD-optimized AI workflows will become a recognized category (Probable)
- Security-first AI adoption will differentiate successful enterprises (Almost Certain)
- Open-source AI infrastructure will mature rapidly (Almost Certain)
- Human-AI partnerships will be measured and optimized like other productivity metrics (Probable)
