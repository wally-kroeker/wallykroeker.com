## Success Indicators (What Actually Matters)

Track these over 12 months:

1. **Consulting pipeline**: Inquiries sourced from blog/content (the real metric)
2. **Speaking invitations**: Podcasts, conferences, panels
3. **Community growth**: GBAIC members + engagement
4. **Content quality**: Positive feedback, reposts, quotes
5. **Author positioning**: "Known for X" (pragmatic AI + infra)

Less important (but still useful):
- Blog traffic (nice to see, not the primary goal)
- Email subscribers (useful list, but not revenue directly)
- LinkedIn followers (vanity metric, but helps with reach)

---

## When to Adjust Strategy

**Red flags** (monthly review):
- Quality declining (rush writing, less depth)
- Client work suffering (boundaries broken)
- Not enjoying the process (unsustainable)
- Metrics flatline for 2+ months (might need content adjustments)
- No consulting inquiries by month 3 (pivot positioning or content)

**Green flags**:
- Biweekly rhythm feels natural
- Quality consistent
- Consulting inquiries increasing
- Community growing
- Getting inbound requests for interviews/speaking

**Adjustment triggers**:
- Month 3 checkpoint: If metrics on track, continue. If behind, audit content and messaging.
- Month 6 checkpoint: If pipeline strong, consider maintaining. If weak, consider weekly for 3 months.
- Month 12 checkpoint: Evaluate entire strategy for next year. What worked? What didn't?

## Support Documents to Read First

Before diving deep:
1. `/home/walub/projects/wallykroeker.com/Draft-2025-Year-of-the-agent-v3.md` (tone/depth reference)
2. `/home/walub/projects/wallykroeker.com/CLAUDE.md` (existing strategy context)
3. `/home/walub/projects/goodfields.io/goodfields.io-PRD.md` (service positioning)

These give context on brand voice, positioning, and what's working already.

## Final Notes

**This is a framework, not dogma.**

Adjust as needed. The key principles:
- Biweekly is sustainable
- Repurposing multiplies impact
- Community (GBAIC) is the moat
- Patience with results (3-6 months)
- Authenticity over perfection

**The content is the product.** Everything else (social, email, community) amplifies it.

Start with Article 1 ("AI ROI Trap" in January). Follow the frameworks. Measure monthly. Adjust quarterly.

You've got this.
