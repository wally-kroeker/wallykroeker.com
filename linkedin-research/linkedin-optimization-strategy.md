---

This strategy focuses on three pillars:
1. **Credibility Architecture**: Profile structure that establishes expertise and trust

---

## SECTION 1: LINKEDIN HEADLINE STRATEGY

### Current State Analysis
**Challenge**: Generic headlines get lost in noise. Technical consultants need headlines that communicate:
- Specific expertise area (AI Security)
- Value proposition (what you DO for clients)
- Differentiation (thought leadership angle)
- Keywords for discoverability

### Headline Formula Analysis

LinkedIn headlines have three components:
1. **Primary Title** (Job title or value statement)
2. **Descriptor** (What you do / who you help)
3. **Differentiator** (Unique positioning)

**Format**: `[Primary Title] | [Descriptor] | [Differentiator]`
**Character Limit**: 220 characters

### 5 Headline Options for Wally

#### Option 1: Authority + Founder (Recommended for immediate launch)
**"AI Security Consultant | Helping Organizations Build Secure AI Systems | Founder of Greybeard AI Collective"**

**Why this works**:
- Leads with credible title and value promise
- Clearly states who you help and what you do
- Founder positioning adds credibility and differentiation
- Keywords: AI Security, Organizations, Secure Systems, Founder
- Length: 107 characters (excellent)

**Best for**: Initial profile setup, founder positioning, SEO for "AI security consultant"

---

#### Option 2: Thought Leadership Focus
**"AI Security Expert & Founder | Securing AI Systems for Enterprise | Thought Leadership in ML Security Risks"**

**Why this works**:
- "Expert" vs "Consultant" adds authority weight
- Specific audience: Enterprise
- Thought leadership angle attracts both B2B leads and speaking opportunities
- Keywords: AI Security, Enterprise, ML Security, Thought Leadership
- Length: 108 characters

**Best for**: Speaking engagements, content distribution, PR visibility

---

#### Option 3: Service-Specific + Value
**"AI Security Architect | Red-teaming, Prompt Injection, Model Poisoning Defense | Building Resilient AI at GoodFields"**

**Why this works**:
- Immediately communicates specific services (red-teaming, threat defense)
- Shows technical depth (specific vulnerabilities you address)
- Natural mention of company within headline
- Keywords: AI Security, Red-teaming, Prompt Injection, Model Poisoning
- Length: 111 characters

**Best for**: Attracting buyers who know their problems and want solutions

---

#### Option 4: Consultant + Advisor Positioning
**"AI Security Consultant & Advisor | Helping CTOs Navigate ML Security Risks | GBAIC Co-Founder | Speaker"**

**Why this works**:
- Dual positioning (consultant + advisor) implies depth of engagement
- Specific buyer persona: CTOs
- Multiple credibility signals: Founder, Speaker
- Keywords: AI Security, CTOs, ML Security, Advisor
- Length: 111 characters

**Best for**: Executive-level positioning, advisory relationships

---

#### Option 5: Technical + Commercial Balance
**"Building Secure AI Systems | Security Architect & Consultant | GoodFields | Greybeard AI Collective"**

**Why this works**:
- Action-oriented opening ("Building Secure AI Systems")
- Both titles show range (architecture + consulting)
- Direct company mentions (better for brand recognition)
- Keywords: Secure AI, Security Architect, GoodFields, GBAIC
- Length: 101 characters

**Best for**: Profile completeness, company SEO boost

---

### Headline Implementation Recommendations

**Phase 1 (Week 1 - Launch)**: Use **Option 1** for maximum clarity and founder credibility

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: Test **Option 2** if you want to emphasize thought leadership focus

**Phase 3 (Ongoing)**: Rotate through options A/B testing:

**SEO Keywords to Prioritize**:

## SECTION 2: PROFILE STRUCTURE FOR TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS

### Profile Section Priority Map

#### 1. PROFILE PHOTO (CRITICAL - Highest impact)
**Current State**: Headshot update needed

**Technical Consultant Photo Best Practices**:

**DO**:
- Professional headshot with clean background (solid light gray, white, or subtle blur)
- Direct eye contact, natural smile (not corporate grimace)
- Shoulders/upper torso framing (shows approachability)
- High resolution (minimum 400x400px, ideally 1200x1500px)
- Warm lighting (avoid harsh shadows on face)
- Clothing: Business casual to business formal (dark blazer on light shirt creates contrast)
- Slight angle (18-22 degrees from directly facing camera feels more dynamic)
- Confident posture (lean slightly forward, shoulders back)

**DON'T**:
- Overly casual tech industry "I don't care about appearance" vibe (signals unprofessionalism to B2B buyers)
- Dark sunglasses, partial face, or unclear features
- Beach/vacation/casual setting photos
- Extreme editing or filters
- Hat, cap, or anything obscuring hair/face
- Cluttered background (desk clutter visible behind)

**Specific Recommendations for Wally**:
- If tech-casual is your style: Dark button-up shirt or light sweater, subtle GBAIC or GoodFields branded item optional
- Outdoor option: Professional setting, natural light, solid background (no busy street)
- Background: Consider GBAIC/GoodFields office setup if location-appropriate
- Expression: Thoughtful + approachable (not stern, not goofy)

**Headshot Session Specifications**:
- Photographer brief: "Professional LinkedIn headshot for B2B AI security consultant, warm but authoritative tone"
- Deliver 3-5 options: different angles, expressions, clothing
- Use photo across: LinkedIn profile, company page, blog/personal site, speaking pages
- Consistency reinforces brand recognition

---

#### 2. ABOUT SECTION (120 words = 80% of profile message)
**Character Limit**: 2,600 characters (but effective About sections are 150-400 words)

**Optimal Structure for Consultants**:

```
[Hook - 1 sentence]
[Problem Statement - 1-2 sentences]
[Solution/Approach - 2-3 sentences]
[Proof Points - 2-3 sentences]
[Call to Action - 1-2 sentences]
[Contact Info - 1 sentence]
```

**Recommended About Section for Wally**:

---

**"Organizations are racing to deploy AI, but security thinking is often an afterthought.**

**The Risk**: Model poisoning, prompt injection, data extraction, fine-tuning attacks—these aren't theoretical anymore. They're happening in production systems.

**My Approach**: I help CTOs and technical leaders understand the AI security landscape and build resilient systems that don't compromise on capability. Through red-teaming, threat modeling, and hands-on consulting, I identify where your AI systems are exposed and what actually matters to fix first.

**My Background**: I've worked across AI/ML technical depth, security architecture, and practical deployment challenges. I co-founded Greybeard AI Collective to bring together experienced practitioners thinking deeply about AI safety and security.

**What I Do**:
- AI security assessments and red-teaming
- Threat modeling for ML systems
- Security architecture reviews
- Hands-on consulting for teams building AI products

**Who I Help**: CTOs, technical founders, and security leaders at companies deploying AI or considering major AI investments.

**Let's talk if**: Your organization is deploying AI and needs to get security right—whether that's assessing your current systems or building secure-by-default into your roadmap.

**Reach out**: DM on LinkedIn, or visit goodfields.io"**

---

**Why This Structure Works**:
- Opens with clear problem (hooks readers immediately)
- Shows specific understanding of AI security threats
- Explains approach in consultant-friendly language (assessment + architecture + hands-on)
- Background lends credibility without resume content
- Specific services listed (easier for buyers to understand what to hire for)
- Clear buyer persona (CTOs, founders)
- Call to action (DM + website)
- Length: ~250 words (ideal engagement length)

---

#### 3. HEADLINE + ABOUT SYNC
**Critical**: Your headline and About must reinforce each other

If Headline is: "AI Security Consultant | Helping Organizations Build Secure AI Systems | Founder of Greybeard AI Collective"

Then About should expand on:
- ✅ Types of organizations you help (CTOs, technical founders, teams deploying AI)
- ✅ What "build secure AI systems" means specifically (red-teaming, threat modeling, architecture review)
- ✅ Why GBAIC matters to your positioning (collective of experienced practitioners thinking about AI safety)

This creates "coherence signal"—profile visitors feel you're authentic and focused, not scattered.

---

#### 4. FEATURED SECTION (Most underused, highest ROI)
**Character Limit**: Up to 50 featured items
**Items You Can Feature**:
- Blog posts (from goodfields.io or wallykroeker.com)
- Articles you've written
- Videos, podcasts you've appeared on
- Documents, presentations (PDFs, slides)
- Company page links
- Media mentions
- Book recommendations

**Featured Content Strategy for Wally**:

**Priority 1 (Launch)**:
1. GoodFields company page link
2. GBAIC organization page link
3. Top 2-3 blog posts about AI security (from wallykroeker.com or goodfields.io)

**Priority 2 (Month 1)**:
4. Speaking recordings (if available)
5. Key articles on AI security threats
6. Press mentions or interviews

**Priority 3 (Month 2+)**:
7. Whitepapers on AI security assessment
8. Resource guides
9. Case study (anonymized client results if applicable)
10. Podcast appearances

**Best Practice**: Refresh featured content every 2 weeks. Trending/recent articles should bubble up. Evergreen content (foundational guides) should stay permanently.

---

**Option A: Chronological with Company Transitions**
```

```

**Experience Section Best Practices for Consultants**:

1. **Lead with current role (GoodFields)**
   - Title: "Founder, Principal AI Security Consultant" or "Founder/Consultant"
   - Description: 3-5 bullet points on services and impact
   - Avoid: Making it look like you have no clients yet

   - Machine Learning Security
   - Red-teaming
   - Security Architecture
   - Threat Modeling
   - Python, TensorFlow, or relevant tools (demonstrates technical depth)

---

#### 6. RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION
**Often Ignored, High Trust Signal**

**Strategy**:
- Get 5-10 recommendations from colleagues, clients, customers
- Recommendations should mention:
  - Specific expertise (AI security, red-teaming, threat modeling)
  - Impact/results (helped identify vulnerabilities, shaped security strategy)
  - Working style (collaborative, technical, strategic)

**What NOT to do**: Generic "Great guy, super smart" recommendations. Specific > Generic.

**Request Template**:
> "I'd really appreciate a recommendation on my LinkedIn profile. If you could mention [specific project/experience] and how it helped your team/organization with [specific outcome], that would be perfect."

## APPENDIX A: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Incomplete Profile** - Missing any major sections signals disorganization
2. **Vague Positioning** - "Consultant" without specialty gets lost in noise
3. **No Cross-Linking** - Visitors land on profile but can't find your services page
4. **Inactive Company Page** - A dead company page is worse than no page (signals defunct)
5. **Generic Content** - Posts that could apply to any consultant get no engagement
6. **Inconsistent Branding** - Different logos/colors across properties confuses audience
7. **No CTAs** - Posts without clear next step (DM, visit website, etc.) don't convert
8. **Stale Headshot** - Outdated photos signal you're not serious about your brand
9. **Weak About Section** - People skip long rambling biographies (structure matters)
10. **Missing Recommendations** - Profiles with no social proof feel risky to engage with
