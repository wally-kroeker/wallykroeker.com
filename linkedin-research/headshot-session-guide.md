### 1 Week Before Session

- [ ] **Avoid heavy meals** - Eat light, balanced meals
- [ ] **Prep workspace** - If doing office background, tidy space

### Day Before Session

## AT THE SESSION - WHAT TO EXPECT

### Before Shooting Starts

- [ ] **Walk through setup** with photographer
  - Confirm location/background
  - Check lighting
  - Ask about any final adjustments
- [ ] **Discuss poses** - What angles will you try?
- [ ] **Preview on camera** - Look at test shot to ensure hair/clothing look right
- [ ] **Relax** - Few minutes to get comfortable

### During Session - Poses to Request

**Pose 1: Classic Straight-On**
- Shoulders facing camera
- Head directly toward camera
- Natural, confident expression
- This is your "default" photo

**Pose 2: Slight 3/4 Turn (Most Flattering)**
- Body angled slightly away from camera
- Head turned toward camera
- Slightly narrower appearance (most people look better in 3/4)
- Use this for primary LinkedIn photo

**Pose 3: More Relaxed/Casual**
- Slight lean forward
- Softer expression
- For website/approachable context

**Pose 4: Serious/Thought Leader Expression**
- Direct eye contact
- More serious expression (not stern)
- For thought leadership content

**Pose 5: Genuine Smile/Warmth**
- Natural laugh or genuine smile
- Eyes engaged (crow's feet should show - sign of real smile)
- For approachable positioning

### During Session - What to Focus On

**Good Habits**:
- Relax shoulders (roll them back and down)
- Slight smile unless doing serious shot
- Direct eye contact with photographer/lens
- Think of something that makes you happy (shows in eyes)
- Take deep breaths between shots
- Ask for feedback ("Does this angle work?")
- Don't be afraid to try different expressions

**Things to Avoid**:
- Tensing up (shoulders high, jaw tight)
- Holding breath (creates forced look)
- Looking directly at you phone/watch
- Talking to photographer in a way that distorts your face
- Changing hair/outfit mid-session without reason
- Looking tired or distracted

### Session Tips (From Professional Photographers)

1. **The "mm" sound**: Have photographer make an "mm" sound before clicking shutter - your face naturally softens in response

2. **The pause after smile**: Smile, then photographer waits 2 seconds before shooting - initial smile looks more natural than caught-in-the-act smile

3. **The lean**: Lean slightly into camera - creates more engaging, confident feel

4. **The eyebrow raise**: Subtle eyebrow raise opens eyes and makes expression more alert

5. **The multiple takes**: Photographer should take 10-20 variations of each pose - one will have perfect expression + lighting

## RETAKE PROTOCOL

### When to Do a Retake Session

**Schedule a retake if**:
- All photos have technical issues (focus, lighting)
- You genuinely dislike how you look in all images
- Significant life change (major haircut, major weight change)
- You want to update style after 1-2 years

**Don't retake if**:
- One or two good options exist (not perfect is okay)
- You're just being overly critical (photographer can help select best)
- Budget doesn't allow (your first headshots are fine)

### Frequency

- **Year 1**: Keep initial headshots
- **Year 2-3**: Consider refresh if brand positioning changes
- **Year 3+**: Definitely update (photos look dated after 3+ years)

## CLOTHING DECISIONS REFERENCE

**Why it Works:**
- More approachable than full blazer

**Best For**: Tech/security consulting, founder positioning

### Option C: Cardigan or Sweater (Warm and Approachable)

**What to Wear:**

- No tie/formal elements

**Why it Works:**
- Very approachable, warm vibe
- Appropriate for both men and women

**Best For**: Community/thought leadership positioning

### RECOMMENDATION FOR WALLY

Given positioning as AI Security Consultant + Founder + Thought Leader:

**Primary Choice**: Option B (Button-up shirt without blazer)
- Shows technical credibility without corporate stuffiness
- Fits "approachable expert" positioning
- Good for GBAIC community positioning

**Alternative**: Option A (Blazer + Light Shirt)
