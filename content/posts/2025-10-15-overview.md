## Work Summary

Made progress on infrastructure and automation across wallykroeker.com and TaskMan projects, plus some overdue workspace maintenance.

### wallykroeker.com

Completed the project hub and timeline system—the foundation for surfacing project history in one place. This creates a centralized view where each project gets its own page with an aggregated timeline pulling from both blog posts and build log milestones. The three-gate publishing system (status/reviewed/sensitivity) is now functional, allowing draft content to coexist with public material.

### TaskMan

Implemented the daily publishing loop integration with N8N running in WSL. This automation will handle commit aggregation and daily summary generation without manual intervention. Also fixed a PATH variable collision in the rollup script that was causing deployment failures.

The publishing loop is the core piece of the ADHD-friendly workflow—offloading repetitive documentation tasks to automation so cognitive effort stays focused on actual work.

### Office Cleaning

Cleared dishes and cups from the workspace (1/7 office cleaning subtasks). Small maintenance task, but workspace clarity tends to correlate with mental clarity.

## Technical Details

**Project Hub System (wallykroeker.com)**
- Centralized project overview pages with timeline aggregation
- Filters content based on frontmatter gates (status, reviewed, sensitivity)
- Dynamic routing via `/projects/[slug]`
- Backward-compatible with existing content defaults

**Publishing Loop (TaskMan)**
- N8N workflow automation for daily commit rollup
- WSL integration for local development environment
- Automated milestone detection via commit conventions
- Human review gates prevent auto-publishing

## Next Steps

**Code:**
- Complete production AI task breakdown workflow in TaskMan
- Implement weekly task summary automation
- Populate project hubs with historical content

**Workspace:**
- Continue office cleaning momentum (6/7 subtasks remaining)
