- What's left:
  - Populate real links for all projects/resources.
  - Publish first field guides (Cloudflare Tunnel + Proxmox, n8n starter, AD audit basics).
  - Configure booking link (Google/Calendly).
  - Announce and run first public test.

- Progress status:  
  MVP is functional and deployed; content and integrations are being finalized. The site is a living space, with ongoing documentation and improvements.
