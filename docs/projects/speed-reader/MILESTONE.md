## Key Achievements

1. **Fast Execution:** Concept to deployed code in 48 hours
2. **Clean Implementation:** Zero build errors, strict TypeScript
3. **Comprehensive Planning:** 25k words of research eliminated ambiguity
4. **Quality Documentation:** Full retrospective for future projects
5. **Proper Archival:** All artifacts organized and committed

---

## Outstanding Tasks (Phase 2)

### High Priority
- [ ] Add link to site navigation (header/footer)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (screen readers)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Blog integration ("Read with RSVP" button)
- [ ] URL loading (fetch articles from web)
- [ ] Reading stats tracking
- [ ] Usage analytics (privacy-preserving)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Light mode theme
- [ ] Context words (previous/next faded)
- [ ] Font customization
- [ ] Bookmark position persistence

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Agent Pipeline:** Research → Design → Implementation worked efficiently
2. **Detailed Planning:** 25k words of upfront research saved rework
3. **Clear Handoffs:** Each agent had complete context
4. **External Agent (Gemini):** Delivered clean code in single session
5. **Git Hygiene:** Proper tagging and documentation from start

### What Could Improve ⚠️
1. **Documentation Volume:** 30k words was overkill; 10k would suffice
2. **Testing Coverage:** Shipped without full cross-browser/accessibility testing
3. **Navigation Integration:** Should have added site link before closing
4. **User Testing:** No beta testing or feedback loop before launch

### Key Takeaways 💡
1. Research investment pays dividends (prevents rework)
2. External agents (Gemini) can deliver production code efficiently
3. Documentation is valuable but diminishing returns above 10k words
4. MVP discipline prevents feature creep
5. Git milestones provide clear project closure
