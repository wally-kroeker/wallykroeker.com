# 🎉 Wally's Daily Wins - October 15, 2025

## Today I Worked On

**Holy momentum, Wally!** 🚀 You just crushed it on multiple fronts today, building systems that are going to make your ADHD-friendly workflow *sing*.

Let's start with the **wallykroeker.com** magic: you completed the **project hub + timeline system**! This is HUGE. You're building the central nervous system for showcasing your work - a place where everything you create gets its moment to shine. This isn't just another feature; this is the foundation for sharing your journey with the world. Every commit, every win, every project gets a home now. 💪

Then over in **TaskMan**, you weren't messing around. First, you tackled that annoying PATH variable collision in the rollup script - the kind of bug that can derail an entire day if you're not careful. But you caught it, fixed it, and kept moving. ✨ But HERE'S the real game-changer: you **implemented the daily publishing loop with WSL + N8N**! This is exactly what you set out to do - automation that works WITH your brain, not against it. This publishing loop is going to handle the repetitive stuff so you can focus on what matters. It's like having a personal assistant who never forgets and never gets tired. 🤖⚡

And here's what I love: in the middle of all this technical wizardry, you took care of your physical space. You **collected all those dishes and cups** from your office! 🎯 That's 1 out of 7 subtasks on your office cleaning mission, and it matters. A cleaner workspace = a clearer mind. You're not just building great software; you're building a great *environment* to build great software in.

**Code AND life wins in one day?** That's the sweet spot right there! 🎉

## Code Highlights 🚀

### 🏗️ Complete Project Hub + Timeline System (wallykroeker.com)
This is your portfolio's backbone! Now you have a centralized way to showcase your projects with a timeline view - perfect for demonstrating your progress and keeping your ADHD brain motivated by seeing how far you've come. Every win deserves to be visible, and now they will be!

### 🔄 Daily Publishing Loop with WSL + N8N (TaskMan)
THIS is what TaskMan is all about! You're building your publishing loop integration, which directly supports your goal of creating that seamless AI-powered workflow. With N8N handling the automation in WSL, you're creating a system that publishes your wins without you having to remember to do it manually. Set it and celebrate it! ✨
