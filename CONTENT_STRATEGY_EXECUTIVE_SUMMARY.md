# Content Calendar Strategy: Executive Summary

**For**: Wally Kroeker (GoodFields Consulting Launch)
**Date**: December 9, 2025
**Duration**: 12-month strategy (Q1 2026 - Q4 2026)
**Status**: Ready to implement

---

## The Strategy in 3 Sentences

Publish biweekly thought leadership articles that position Wally as the rare expert bridging infrastructure, security, and pragmatic AI adoption. Each article generates 5-7 pieces of secondary content (LinkedIn, email, Twitter) to multiply reach. Build GBAIC (Greybeard AI Collective) as a practitioner community that becomes the moat for GoodFields consulting.

---

## Why This Works

1. **Sustainable for solo consultant** - Biweekly (not weekly) allows quality + client work
2. **Content compounds** - 12+ articles + repurposing = SEO flywheel over 6-12 months
3. **Multiplies reach** - 1 article becomes 5-7 social/email pieces; reach 10x
4. **Community is moat** - GBAIC differentiates from commodity consulting
5. **Drives consulting pipeline** - Primary goal: qualified inquiries (not just traffic)

## The Plan at a Glance

### Publishing Frequency
**Biweekly (every 2 weeks), Tuesdays at 9 AM**

Why biweekly?
- Allows 1-2 weeks for main article + 1-2 weeks for filler/buffer
- 6 days of paid client work per fortnight (maintain revenue)
- Quality over quantity (3,000+ word articles with depth)
- Sustainable long-term (no burnout)

### Next 3 Articles (In Order)

**Article 1: "The AI ROI Trap: Why Your Pilots Always Look Good (And How to Tell If They'll Actually Work)"**
- Publish: January 7, 2026
- Angle: Consultant's perspective on why AI pilots fail in production
- Target: CTO/IT leaders evaluating AI
- Word count: 3,000-3,500
- CTA: GoodFields "AI Strategy" service

**Article 2: "Security-First AI: How to Build Guardrails Before You Build Features"**
- Publish: February 4, 2026
- Angle: Good security design enables faster, cheaper AI
- Target: Security teams, compliance-conscious orgs
- Word count: 2,500-3,000
- CTA: GoodFields "Security Assessment" service

**Article 3: "Building Your Home Lab as a Learning Tool: From Proxmox to Production Patterns"**
- Publish: February 18 or March 4, 2026
- Angle: FabLab architecture + hands-on credibility
- Target: Infrastructure engineers, DIY enthusiasts
- Word count: 3,000-3,500
- CTA: FabLab project + GBAIC

### Content Repurposing (5-7 pieces per article)

Each article is automatically distributed as:
1. **LinkedIn teasers** (3-5 per week, 100-150 words each)
2. **Email newsletter** (summary + bonus insight)
3. **Twitter threads** (4-6 tweets, teaching-focused)
4. **LinkedIn article** (republish with professional framing)
5. **Short-form posts** (off-weeks, 300-800 words)
6-7. **Guides/checklists** (quarterly, downloadable)

**Result**: 1 article becomes 5-7 distribution pieces = 10x reach multiplier

## GoodFields Integration

**Every article ends with**:

CTA 1: "Working on this challenge? GoodFields specializes in [relevant service]"
- Link to goodfields.io
- "Book a free 60-minute consult"

CTA 2: "Join Greybeard AI Collective for peer learning"
- Link to GBAIC community
- Consistent across all articles

**Subtle integration**:
- Link to relevant projects (FabLab, Bob, PAI)
- Real examples from consulting (anonymized)
- "If you need hands-on help, GoodFields specializes in..."

**Non-salesy approach**: Content is the product. CTAs are helpful, not pushy.

---

## One-Time Setup (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Email list (Substack or Ghost) - fast, free tier available
- [ ] GBAIC community (Discord or Slack) - free tier sufficient
- [ ] Content calendar (Notion or Spreadsheet) - 3-month pipeline
- [ ] Analytics (Google Search Console + blog stats) - free
- [ ] Social scheduling (Buffer or native posting) - optional
- [ ] Git workflow for drafts - already have

**Total setup time**: ~2 hours
**Start date**: Early January 2026 (before first article publish)

## Why Biweekly Works (vs. Weekly)

| Aspect | Weekly | Biweekly | Winner |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Sustainability | Hard long-term | Natural rhythm | Biweekly |
| Client work | Suffers | Coexists | Biweekly |
| Quality | Variable | Consistent | Biweekly |
| SEO impact | Slow | Compounding | Same |
| Team size | Needs support | Solo works | Biweekly |
| Burnout risk | High | Low | Biweekly |
| Community growth | Faster | Still strong | Weekly |

**Biweekly is the right rhythm for a solo consultant with paid client work.**

If consulting revenue explodes, can increase to weekly. Until then, biweekly wins.

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Quality declines**
- Mitigation: Biweekly pace + 3-article buffer built in advance

**Risk 2: Consulting revenue overwhelms schedule**
- Mitigation: Content is marketing (ROI justifies time investment)

**Risk 3: Traffic doesn't grow**
- Mitigation: Patience (3-6 months to SEO payoff); success = consulting inquiries, not vanity traffic

**Risk 4: Community maintenance burden**
- Mitigation: Start small (50 members); community members help moderate; practitioner-led model

**Risk 5: Topic fatigue**
- Mitigation: 12-month topic backlog (Part 5 of main strategy); rotate across 4 pillars

## One Final Note

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.**

SEO takes 3-6 months. Consulting pipeline builds over time. Community grows slow, then exponential. Quality compounds. Authenticity pays off.

Stick with it. Measure monthly. Adjust quarterly.

**You've got everything you need. Let's build something that lasts.**
