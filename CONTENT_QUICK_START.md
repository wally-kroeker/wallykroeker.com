## Sustainability Check (Monthly)

Ask yourself:
1. Is the biweekly rhythm sustainable? (Quality not declining?)
2. Is client work suffering? (Good boundary between content & consulting?)
3. Do I enjoy this? (Is the writing energizing, not draining?)
4. Are the metrics moving? (Traffic, community, inquiries?)
5. What surprised me this month?

## One Last Thing

**This is a marathon, not a sprint.**

SEO payoff takes 3-6 months. Consulting pipeline builds over time. Community growth is slow at first, then exponential.

Stick with it. Adjust monthly. The content compounds.
