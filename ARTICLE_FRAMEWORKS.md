# Article Writing Frameworks & Templates

Quick templates to accelerate article writing. Each can be adapted for different topics.

2. **The Trap Explained** (2-3 sections)
   - What is the trap? (define it)
   - Why do smart people fall for it? (psychology/structure/incentives)
   - What does it cost? (money, time, opportunity cost, reputation)
   - Include data if available

3. **Why It's Harder Than It Looks** (1-2 sections)
   - Common objections/pushback

   - Use concrete numbers

6. **Closing** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Reframe the problem in light of guardrails
   - Call to action (GoodFields service, GBAIC, further learning)

### Tone

   - Why is their perspective valuable?
   - What problem/challenge do they solve?

2. **The Challenge** (3-5 Q&A pairs)
   - Q: What was the original problem?

   - Synthesis of key insights
   - Why this matters for the broader community
   - Call to action (GBAIC, GoodFields, further learning)

### Tone
- Curious, not interrogatory
- Highlight their expertise
- Make them look good (edit for clarity, not brevity)
- Your voiceover adds value (don't just publish Q&A)

### Logistics
- Async interview (email/DM better than synchronous for solo consultant)
- 5-10 prepared questions, room for follow-up
- Edit for flow but keep their voice
- Credit them prominently
- Link to their LinkedIn/company

## Framework 4: "The Reaction" (Thought Leadership Articles)

- Infrastructure/pragmatism lens
- Timely but forward-looking

### Timing
- Publish within 3-5 days of news (while still relevant)
- Use as filler content (doesn't need to be a main article)

## Writing Tips & Shortcuts

### Outlining (5 min)
1. Write headline
2. List 5-7 main sections (one sentence each)
3. Under each, note 2-3 key points
4. Done. Start writing from outline.

### Drafting (30-60 min)
1. Write sections in order of clarity, not outline order (easiest first)
2. Don't edit while drafting (turn off your inner critic)
3. Use headers and bullet points liberally (helps flow)
4. Quotes and code blocks break up text (add them as you write)

### Editing (30 min)
1. Read aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
2. Cut jargon (assume smart reader, not domain expert)
3. Verify numbers/dates/links
4. Check header hierarchy (H1 once, then H2s for sections)
5. Add internal links (to other articles, projects, GoodFields)

### Final QA (10 min)
- Spelling/grammar (spell-check first, then skim)
- Meta tags filled in (title, description, tags)
- CTA present (GoodFields or GBAIC)
- Frontmatter correct (date, tags, status)

---

## Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too much detail, not enough narrative**
   - Readers want to understand the "why", not just the "how"
   - Tell a story, then provide details

2. **Burying the lede**
   - Opening paragraph should answer: "Why should I read this?"
   - Not: "Let me tell you about the history of..."

3. **Assuming too much knowledge**
   - Explain jargon first time used
   - Cite sources if making claims

4. **Ignoring mobile readers**
   - Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
   - Headers every 200-300 words
   - Bullet points instead of dense paragraphs

5. **Weak calls to action**
   - Don't ask "let me know what you think"
   - Do ask: "What's your biggest challenge with [topic]?" or "Join the community discussion"

6. **Too much self-promotion**
   - One CTA at the end is fine
   - Integrating lessons naturally is fine
   - Multiple pitches per article feels spammy

7. **Not citing sources**
   - Include links to research, tools, projects
   - Cite statistics (link to source)
   - Builds credibility and helps readers go deeper

---

## Length Targets

- **Main articles**: 2,500-3,500 words (30-45 min read)
- **Thought leadership**: 1,500-2,500 words (20-30 min read)
- **Guides**: 1,000-2,000 words (15-20 min read)
- **Quick takes**: 300-800 words (5-10 min read)
- **Reactions**: 400-800 words (5-10 min read)

## Tools to Speed Up Writing

1. **Bob (AI assistant)**: Outline generation, fact-checking, first-draft sections
2. **Hemingway Editor**: Catches overly complex sentences
3. **Google Docs Comments**: Collaboration if outsourcing editing
4. **Git diff**: Before/after on major revisions

## One Final Template: The LinkedIn Teaser Algorithm

Pick one of these patterns per article section. Mix and match.

**Pattern 1: The Stat**
```
X% of [audience] [surprising finding].

The [consequence] is [big impact].

Why? → [blog link]
```

**Pattern 2: The Question**
```
Have you ever [relatable frustration]?

You're not alone. Here's what's actually happening: [blog link]
```

**Pattern 3: The Reframe**
```
We talk about [conventional wisdom] all wrong.

It's actually about [better framing].

Here's why: [blog link]
```

**Pattern 4: The Lesson**
```
Learned something hard this week: [one sentence lesson].

Full breakdown on the blog: [blog link]
```

**Pattern 5: The Contrarian**
```
Hot take: [opposite of what people believe]

Here's why I think it's true: [blog link]
```

Each LinkedIn teaser should be 100-150 words, maximum. Include 1-2 sentences of explanation, then link. Done.
