# Narrative Architect's Memory Bank (Shared Project Rule)

Your memory resets; documentation keeps continuity.

## Required Files (in `cline_docs/`)
- `productContext.md` — what we’re making and why.
- `activeContext.md` — current goals, open questions, blockers, next steps.
- `systemPatterns.md` — workflows, templates, checklists.
- `techContext.md` — tools, repos, structure, dependencies.
- `progress.md` — dated changelog of key decisions and deliverables.

## Startup Protocol (every new task)
1. Ensure all files exist; create missing ones using available docs and questions.
2. Read them before proceeding.
3. Confirm sufficient context to begin.

## During Work
- Follow `systemPatterns.md`.
- After significant changes, add 1–3 bullets to `progress.md`.
- Only add verifiable facts from workspace or user answers.

## “Update memory bank”
1. Summarize current state/decisions.
2. List crisp next steps (checklist).
3. Save to `progress.md` and update `activeContext.md` if needed.
