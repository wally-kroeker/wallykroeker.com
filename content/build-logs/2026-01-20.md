# Build Log - January 20, 2026

## Afternoon Session (1:01 PM)

Spent the evening debugging why n8n workflow configuration instructions weren't working. Classic case of documentation describing UI elements incorrectly. I kept telling the user to 'select Expression from the dropdown' but Expression isn't a dropdown option - it's a toggle button at the top right of the field. Only discovered this when the user shared a screenshot showing the actual UI. The dropdown is for content type (JSON, Form Data, etc.) and the toggle switches between Fixed values and Expression mode. Once we saw the actual interface, everything clicked. Updated DEPLOY-NOW.md with the correct pattern: select JSON from dropdown, click Expression toggle, enter the expression. Also realized the Parse Message code in the live workflow was missing the notionPayload construction - it was old code that just returned basic fields. The correct code exists in parse-message-node-code.js but needs to be copied into the n8n UI. Bill had confirmed the approach was sound, but we were debugging the wrong thing until the screenshots showed the real issue.

## Afternoon Session (1:10 PM)

Wally opened a new project directory called TSFUR (The Search for Ultimate Reality) - an old Discord server name that he wanted to repurpose as a personal conversation space. Not for project work, but for philosophy, brain dumps, and staying accountable. The goal was to make it a place where I already know what's pressing in his life when he shows up. We designed a two-tier system: TSFUR for thinking and talking, project folders for doing and tracking. Created TSFUR/CLAUDE.md with a session start protocol that auto-loads his TELOS context (goals, projects, challenges) every time. Built out current-priorities.md that surfaces urgent items - Security Folk training deadlines, Red River Mutual job in reference check stage, Greybeard AI meetup coming up. Then we tackled the bigger pattern: standardized project structure. Used Security-Folk as the reference implementation. Created CLAUDE.md (project context and how I help), tasks.md (24 tracked tasks with states), and STATUS.md (quick reference for 'what do I work on today?'). The Security Folk stuff had gotten muddled - he thought he missed the Jan 17-18 session but actually it was cancelled due to winter storm and rescheduled to February. Updated everything to reflect the real timeline. The pattern is ADHD-aware: reduces activation energy, celebrates completion, no shame accountability. It's replicable across all his projects - GoodFields, FabLab, everything. TSFUR becomes home base for life conversations. Projects become execution spaces with clear task tracking. Clean separation between being and doing.
