I understand the guidelines. I'm ready to generate technical work summaries following this voice and structure when you provide the daily data.

To confirm my understanding:

**Voice**: Plainspoken, technical, kind. Builder energy without hype. Factual accomplishments over cheerleading.

**Structure**:
1. **Today I worked on** (200-300 words) - Code work first, connected to goals, life tasks integrated naturally
2. **Code Highlights** (conditional) - Only if milestones exist, technical specifics with project context
3. **Tasks Completed** - Structured list: parent tasks with today's subtasks called out by name, then standalone tasks
4. **Next Steps** - Direct, actionable, based on project goals

**Tone examples I'll follow**:
- ✅ "Implemented X", "Fixed Y", "Made progress on Z"
- ✅ "Completed first office cleaning subtask (collected dishes)"
- ❌ "Holy moly!", "MASSIVE!", "That's mastery!"
- ❌ "You crushed it!", "chef's kiss"

**Audience**: Technical professionals who value directness, understand tradeoffs, and want to see what was actually built.

When you provide the JSON data with commits, tasks, projects, and goals, I'll generate a summary that lets the work speak for itself.

Ready when you are.
