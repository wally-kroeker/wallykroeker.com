## 2025-10-15 — Planning and infrastructure complete

- **Summary:** Reviewed external spec from brainstorming agent, identified 7 critical misalignments with existing codebase, and implemented complete project hub + timeline system. Fixed broken frontmatter, extended TypeScript types, added filtering gates, created `/projects/[slug]` route with timeline aggregation from both blog posts and build log milestones.

- **Why it matters:**
  - Establishes the foundation for automated content generation via n8n
  - Creates single source of truth for each project with unified timeline
  - Respects privacy with three-gate system (status/reviewed/sensitivity)
  - Maintains separation between tutorials (/guides), daily updates (/blog), and living project docs (/projects)

- **Commits:**
  - fix(content): convert building post to proper YAML frontmatter
  - feat(lib): extend PostMeta with publishing gates and project fields
  - feat(lib): add isPublic() filtering helper with backward compatibility
  - feat(blog): filter posts using isPublic() gate
  - feat(lib): add H2 section parsing and getAllPosts helper
  - feat(lib): create projectUpdates with timeline aggregation logic
  - feat(app): create /projects/[slug] route with timeline UI
  - content(projects): add publishing-loop project hub and initial milestone

- **Artifacts:**
  - `lib/markdown.ts` - Extended types, filtering, H2 parsing
  - `lib/projectUpdates.ts` - Timeline aggregation logic
  - `app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` - Project hub route
  - `content/projects/wk-site/` - This project's content

- **Next steps:**
  - Create sample daily overview post with project reference to test timeline
  - Test filtering with draft states
  - Document schema in CLAUDE.md for global agent awareness
  - Create `.publishing-config.json` for n8n integration
