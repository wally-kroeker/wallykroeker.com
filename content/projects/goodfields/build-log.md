## 2025-10-23 — Portfolio Project Publishing Integration

**Commit**: [`7fc25dd`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/goodfields.io/commit/7fc25dd)

This commit adds the GoodFields project as a new case study to the main portfolio site, detailing its technical architecture and outcomes. To automate future updates, the project's build log was integrated into the central publishing loop. This system uses an N8N workflow to pull new milestone commits from the repository and update the project timeline automatically. This integration ensures the case study remains current with minimal manual intervention, providing a live look at the project's evolution.

## 2025-10-23 — Initial Production Deployment (v0.1)

**Commit**: [`2986df7`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/goodfields.io/commit/2986df7)

Deployed the initial v0.1 version of the GoodFields landing page to a production environment. This milestone establishes the core infrastructure, including a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments. A Cloudflare Tunnel was configured to securely expose the web service to the public without opening inbound firewall ports. This provides an important security layer, DDoS protection, and caching for performance. The initial deployment makes the site live and ready for traffic, featuring service offerings and case study placeholders.

## 2025-10-23 — Documentation and Deployment Tooling

**Commit**: [`8cd18e5`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/goodfields.io/commit/8cd18e5)

Introduced foundational operational tooling and comprehensive documentation for the project. This includes setup scripts for local development, containerization definitions via a Dockerfile, and the initial CI/CD pipeline configuration. Detailed README files were added to document the build process, deployment strategy, and key architectural decisions. This work is critical for long-term maintainability, onboarding new contributors, and ensuring consistent, repeatable deployments. The goal is to reduce operational friction by codifying the project's infrastructure.

## 2025-10-22 — Proof Strip Copy Update

**Commit**: [`b1694c3`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/goodfields.io/commit/b1694c3)

This commit refines the marketing copy within the site's "proof strip" component, which highlights key client results and testimonials. The language was updated to be more direct and impact-focused, incorporating feedback from initial user reviews. This change is part of an iterative process to improve the clarity of the value proposition for potential clients. No major technical changes were involved, as this was purely a content update versioned in the repository for tracking.
