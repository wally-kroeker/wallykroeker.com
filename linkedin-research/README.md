## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Should I update everything at once?**
A: No. Execute Priority 1 (profile updates) this week, Priority 2-3 (company page + headshot) next week. This allows time for changes to take effect and doesn't overwhelm you.

**Q: How long before I see results?**
A: Headline changes can show impact within 24-48 hours. Headshot uploads show significant impact within 1-2 weeks. Consistent content and cross-linking show compounding effects over 60-90 days.

**Q: Should I delete old content if it doesn't fit new positioning?**
A: Selectively. Keep experience/credentials that built toward current positioning. Archive or hide irrelevant old content. Delete nothing until you're sure you don't want it visible.

**Q: How often should I post?**
A: Start with 1-2 posts per week. Consistency matters more than frequency. Better to post 1x/week reliably than 5x/week sporadically then disappear.

**Q: What if I don't want to do a full company page?**
A: The personal profile optimization alone (Sections 1-2) will deliver 50% of the benefit. Company page amplifies and establishes official business presence, but personal profile is the foundation.

**Q: How much does a professional headshot cost?**
A: Typically $150-500 for professional session with multiple final images. Investment pays for itself in professional brand establishment.
