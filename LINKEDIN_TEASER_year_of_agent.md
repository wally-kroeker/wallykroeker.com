## Draft Post

Remember all those headlines claiming 2025 would be the "Year of the Agent"?

I just spent the last few weeks researching what actually happened. The short version:

**2025 wasn't the Year of the Agent. It was the year we found the edges.**

Here's what the production data shows:

• 95% of AI agent projects failed to reach meaningful production (MIT study of 1,837 teams)

• 80% of companies say their agents took unintended actions - including accessing unauthorized systems and exposing sensitive data

• 70% of teams running agents in production rebuild their stack every three months or faster

But here's the thing: **if you're frustrated with AI agents right now, that means you're doing the real work.**

The real work is:
- Instrumenting agents like any distributed system
- Designing for failure modes, not happy paths
- Writing runbooks instead of just demos
- Documenting what doesn't work, not just what plays well on stage

This is exactly what we saw with cloud computing in 2008-2011 and virtualization in the early 2000s. The trough of disillusionment isn't failure - it's where we separate technology that works from technology that merely demos well.

### Where Agents Actually Shine

I've found one area where agents are genuinely transformative: infrastructure and configuration work.

In my own homelab (I call it FabLab), I've used AI agents to deploy financial tooling, generate Docker Compose configs, and even build a Claude Code skill that adds DNS records via OPNsense API - all with human approval, of course.

The pattern: **treat agents as syntax accelerators and documentation engines, not as autonomous operators you hand the pager to.**

### The Greybeard AI Collective

This is why I'm starting the Greybeard AI Collective - a place for infrastructure and ops folks who've lived through previous hype cycles to share what actually works (and what doesn't).

Not vendor pitches. Not slideware. Just practitioners sharing honest patterns.

If you're the person everyone asks about Copilot, or you maintain the homelab that quietly outperforms half your vendor stack, or you're trying to balance "play with the new thing" against "please don't break payroll" - you're exactly who this is for.

Curious what your experience has been with AI agents in production. What's working? What's still brittle?

## Alternative Opening Hooks (choose one)

**Option 1** (current): "Remember all those headlines claiming 2025 would be the 'Year of the Agent'?"

**Option 2**: "In November, I had beers with two greybeard infrastructure folks. We started talking about AI agents. The conversation led to something unexpected."

**Option 3**: "95% of AI agent projects failed to reach production this year. But that's not the story the hype cycle wants you to hear."

**Option 4**: "I just finished a deep research dive into what actually happened with AI agents in 2025. The reality is very different from the headlines."

## Notes

- **Word count**: ~385 words (fits LinkedIn feed without "see more" truncation)
- **Link placement**: Clear CTA to wallykroeker.com article
- **Data hooks**: MIT 95% stat is attention-grabbing, credible
- **Personal credibility**: FabLab examples show you're building, not just theorizing
- **GBAIC invitation**: Natural, earned, not pushy
- **Engagement prompt**: Ends with question to spark comments
- **Hashtags**: Relevant to target audience (infrastructure/security practitioners)

## Timing Recommendation

**Best time to post**:
- **Tuesday or Wednesday, Jan 2-8, 2026**
- **Early morning (7-9am local)** or **lunch hour (12-1pm local)**
- Reasoning: People back from holidays, catching up on industry news, higher engagement than Dec 26-Jan 1

**If posting during holidays (Dec 26-31)**:
- Lower engagement expected
- But less competition in feed
- Good for "evergreen" content that can resurface later

Your call on timing.
