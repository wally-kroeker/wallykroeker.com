## 2025-10-21 — Comprehensive Documentation Update

**Commit**: [`5ba6f5a`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob/commit/5ba6f5a)

Completed a full documentation pass covering the skills-based architecture, PAI synchronization patterns, and implementation details. Documentation now provides clear guidance on how Bob extends PAI's core agent framework with specialized skill modules. Added architectural decision records explaining the reasoning behind key design choices. This documentation establishes a foundation for both ongoing development and potential upstream contributions to PAI. The update makes the codebase more maintainable and easier for others to understand the project's technical direction.
