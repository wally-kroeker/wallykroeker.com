A Git-first, zero-friction publishing system that automatically translates daily engineering work into transparent public updates. Commits become content, milestones become build logs, and progress becomes visibleâ€”all with minimal overhead.

Built to support the "build in public" philosophy while maintaining privacy controls through frontmatter gates.
