> **Raw note:** "I need to figure out Wally Kroeker. I’m crafting my online presence. I want everyone to thrive, not just me. The site should reflect that philosophy and make it easy for others to reuse what I build."

## Why This Build Matters
WallyKroeker.com is more than a portfolio — it’s a public workshop. Every choice, from tech stack to tone, follows the compass: **Build open, useful systems so more people can thrive.** This first release is the scaffolding for years of public builds.

## Key Decisions
- **Framework:** Next.js + Tailwind for speed and flexibility.
- **Deployment:** Proxmox LXC with Cloudflare Tunnel for secure, tracker-free publishing.
- **Structure:** Dark-first minimal design, clear CTAs, privacy-respecting defaults.
- **Content model:** Markdown for posts, easy to version control.
- **Navigation:** Projects, Cognitive Loop, Blog, Community, Work With Me.

## What's Live in MVP
- Homepage with hero, compass, featured projects.
- Project cards for Cognitive Loop, The Search for Ultimate Reality, StillPoint, Homelab/AI/Security Builds.
- Cognitive Loop section linking to Substack and “What is Cognitive Loop?” explainer.
- Technical Blog index.
- Community section linking to Discord.
- Work With Me section with booking and socials.
- Footer with privacy note and colophon.

## Next Steps
- Populate real links for all projects and resources.
- Publish first field guides (Cloudflare Tunnel + Proxmox, n8n starter, AD audit basics).
- Configure booking link (Google or Calendly).
- Deploy live and run first public test.

## Reflection
This isn’t a finished site — it’s a living space. Every improvement, guide, and experiment gets documented so others can replicate or adapt it. The compass keeps it aligned: **usefulness over perfection, transparency over mystique, community over ego.**
