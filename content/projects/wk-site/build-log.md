## 2025-10-16 — Dynamic Project Hubs

**Commit**: [`0cced06`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/0cced06)

Merged publishing-loop repository into main site codebase and implemented dynamic project hub pages. Each project now generates its own hub view with timeline, milestones, and build log entries. The consolidation simplifies deployment by eliminating the separate publishing-loop repo while maintaining all automation functionality. Project hubs pull from structured data files and render consistent navigation across the portfolio site.

## 2025-10-15 — Production Publishing System

**Commit**: [`d119418`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/d119418)

Finalized the automated publishing pipeline for production use. The system now runs reliably on a daily schedule, pulling commit data from multiple repositories and generating build log entries. Integrated WSL-based cron scheduling with N8N workflow automation to handle the daily rollup process. Added error handling and logging to track pipeline execution. This establishes the foundation for automated portfolio updates without manual intervention.

## 2025-10-15 — COMPASS Voice Alignment

**Commit**: [`80a2910`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/80a2910)

Refined the N8N daily overview prompt to match the tone and style defined in COMPASS.md. The AI-generated summaries now use plainspoken builder language focused on technical substance rather than marketing hype. Updated prompt engineering to emphasize clarity, directness, and relevance to technical decisions. This ensures consistency across all automated content generation and maintains the portfolio's authentic voice.

## 2025-10-15 — Project Timeline System

**Commit**: [`09e8c74`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/09e8c74)

Built the complete project hub and timeline rendering system. Projects display chronological milestone progressions with commit hashes, dates, and technical summaries. The timeline structure organizes work into digestible entries that show evolution over time. Implemented data schema for storing milestone information and template components for consistent display. This provides visitors clear visibility into project development history.

## 2025-10-20 — Publishing Loop Documentation

**Commit**: [`827e1c1`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/827e1c1)

Added comprehensive documentation for the publishing loop automation system that runs daily via WSL and N8N. The system handles automated rollup of daily activities and generates AI-powered summaries for the portfolio site. Documentation covers the technical workflow from data collection through summary generation and publishing. This establishes the foundation for automated content updates without manual intervention. The milestone entries track progress on timeline visualization and build log systems that showcase project evolution. Core infrastructure now supports continuous documentation of development work.

## 2025-10-20 — Publishing Loop Automation

**Commit**: [`4e755af`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/4e755af)

Integrated automation script that orchestrates daily publishing workflows using WSL and N8N. The system enables automated daily rollups of project activity and generates AI-powered summaries without manual intervention. Setup includes script integration for the publishing loop alongside cleanup of legacy automation code. This creates a foundation for consistent daily publishing cadence tied to build log and timeline systems. The automation bridges local development environment (WSL) with workflow orchestration (N8N) for reliable scheduled execution.

## 2025-10-21 — Bob/PAI Publishing Integration

**Commit**: [`0a51796`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com/commit/0a51796)

Connected the Bob project and its PAI foundation into the automated publishing loop. This enables daily rollup posts to automatically include updates from the skills-based architecture work happening in Bob. The integration required mapping Bob's milestone commits to the existing N8N workflow that generates daily summaries. This brings Bob development activity into the same visibility system as the main site work, making cross-project progress tracking more cohesive.
