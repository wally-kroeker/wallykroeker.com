Work/Services        3/10  - Critical gap, needs complete expansion
Projects             6/10  - Good layout, needs curation by audience

Navigation          7/10  - Good structure, wrong order

IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED (Next 2 Weeks):
==========================================

1. CREATE ABOUT PAGE
   - Add professional headshot (photographer, AI service, or DIY)
   - Write 2-3 paragraph bio covering background, expertise, why started GoodFields
   - List key credentials: SANS training, 20+ years experience, past companies
   - Add to header navigation
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours + photo shoot

2. EXPAND WORK/SERVICES PAGE
   - Define 3-4 core service offerings (AI security audits, infrastructure assessment, etc.)
   - Define ideal client persona
   - Outline engagement process and timeline
   - Add investment/pricing range
   - Include clear CTA ("Book Consultation", not just calendar link)
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours

3. CREATE SERVICES OVERVIEW PAGE
   - 1-page GoodFields service summary
   - Who benefits from each service
   - Example problems you solve
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (Next Month):
======================================

4. Reorder navigation: Work/Services → Projects → Blog → Cognitive Loop → Community → About
5. Add social proof: testimonials, client list, case study (even 1 example)
6. Publish 2-3 AI security blog posts (thought leadership)
7. Fix technical details: env vars, console.log, mobile nav
8. Expand Privacy Policy (GDPR compliance)
9. Create FAQ page (consulting process, rates, timeline)

TONE & VOICE ISSUES:
====================
Current voice: Friendly, technical, philosophical (strong but unfocused)
Problems for consulting:
- Too personal/hobby-focused
- Too vague ("useful systems" doesn't differentiate)
- Philosophy emphasized equally with business results
- Confidence gaps in some content (self-doubt narrative)

Fix: Rebalance toward results-focused, authoritative-but-warm tone for business content

SEO & DISCOVERY ISSUES:
========================
- Title tags don't include keywords (should have "security consultant," "AI security," etc.)
- Missing meta descriptions on most pages
- No Schema.org structured data (Person, Organization, Service)
- No sitemap.xml
- No keyword targeting strategy evident

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
==========================

PRIMARY: Reposition from "builder of interesting systems" → "trusted AI security consultant"

1. Visual: Add professional photo throughout site (especially About, Home, Work pages)
2. Content: Create 3-5 security/AI security blog posts for thought leadership
3. Clarity: Separate and elevate professional work (GoodFields, consulting) over hobby projects
4. Credibility: Add social proof (testimonials, case studies, client list)
5. Services: Define and clearly communicate what you sell and to whom

POSITIONAL CHANGE REQUIRED:
===========================
Current: "Builder of open, useful systems + AI enthusiast + ADHD workflow person"
Target:  "Security architect specializing in AI infrastructure + automation for enterprises"

The home page compass and Cognitive Loop are great, but they're not why someone hires a consultant.
Move those to secondary position and lead with: expertise, credibility, results, authority.

LOUISE WAS RIGHT:
==================
Professional headshot is critical—not just for visual appeal, but as a symbol of
taking the consulting business seriously and establishing personal authority.

Without it: "interesting side project selling services"
With it: "serious professional offering expert consulting"

The photo should go on About page (primary), Work page, and optionally Home page.

QUICK WINS (High Impact, Low Effort):
=====================================
1. Add professional photo to About page (1 day)
2. Fix env vars and console.log (1 hour)
3. Reorder navigation (30 minutes)
4. Expand Work page to 500+ words (2 hours)
5. Create FAQ on consulting (1-2 hours)
6. Update title tags and meta descriptions (1-2 hours)

ESTIMATED TOTAL EFFORT FOR CORE IMPROVEMENTS:
==============================================
Must-do items:  8-10 hours
Should-do items: 8-10 hours
Nice-to-have:    4-6 hours

Three-month outcome: Professional consulting site with clear positioning,
credibility markers, and effective sales path.
