## 2025-10-21 — Comprehensive Documentation Update

**Commit**: [`5ba6f5a`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob/commit/5ba6f5a)

Completed a full documentation pass covering the skills-based architecture, PAI synchronization patterns, and implementation details. Documentation now provides clear guidance on how Bob extends PAI's core agent framework with specialized skill modules. Added architectural decision records explaining the reasoning behind key design choices. This documentation establishes a foundation for both ongoing development and potential upstream contributions to PAI. The update makes the codebase more maintainable and easier for others to understand the project's technical direction.

## 2025-10-21 — Vikunja Task Management Skill

**Commit**: [`15a9bc9`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob/commit/15a9bc9)

Introduced a new "skill" module to the Bob agent, enabling it to interact directly with the Vikunja task management API. This skill encapsulates all the necessary logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks and sub-tasks. It exposes a standardized interface that other parts of the agent can use without needing to know the specifics of the Vikunja API. This modular, skills-based architecture is a key step in allowing the agent to easily integrate with new tools and services in the future.

## 2025-10-21 — Comprehensive Documentation Update

**Commit**: [`5ba6f5a`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob/commit/5ba6f5a)

A major update to the project's internal and external documentation. This commit includes detailed explanations of the skills-based architecture, the agent's core processing loop, and the data flow for PAI synchronization. API documentation was generated for all major modules, and a contributor's guide was added to streamline the process for onboarding. This effort aims to reduce knowledge silos and make the system more maintainable. Clear documentation is a prerequisite for refining the architecture and synchronizing with upstream PAI.
