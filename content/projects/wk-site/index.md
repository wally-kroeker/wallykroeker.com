Personal website and technical blog built with Next.js 14. A Git-first publishing system where commits become blog posts, featuring automated daily overviews, project timelines, and build logsâ€”all with privacy controls through frontmatter gates.

Built to support the "build in public" philosophy while maintaining transparency and minimal overhead.
