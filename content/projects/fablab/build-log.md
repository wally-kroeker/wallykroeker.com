## 2025-11-16 — Initial Repository Setup

**Commit**: [`0202f6d`](https://github.com/wally-kroeker/fablab/commit/0202f6d)

Created the dedicated FabLab repository for infrastructure documentation and tracking. Established the foundational directory structure with separate folders for documentation, configuration files, network diagrams, and inventory tracking. This milestone marks the beginning of systematic infrastructure documentation, bringing the same rigor to personal infrastructure that would be applied to enterprise environments.

The repository integrates with three key systems: the telos skill for strategic planning and accountability, the publishing loop for automated milestone tracking via wallykroeker.com, and TaskMan (Vikunja) for granular task management. This integration ensures that infrastructure work is tracked, prioritized appropriately against income-generating work (GoodFields consulting), and documented for both operational needs and portfolio credibility.
