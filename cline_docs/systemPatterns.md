- Key technical decisions:
  - Next.js + Tailwind for speed, flexibility, and minimalism.
  - Markdown-based content for transparency and version control.
  - Deployment on Proxmox LXC containers for isolation and reproducibility.
  - Cloudflare Tunnel for secure, tracker-free HTTPS publishing (no public inbound, no reverse proxy).
  - Systemd for process management.
  - No heavy JS, no trackers, no lock-in.

- Architecture patterns:
  - Static and dynamic content served via Next.js.
  - Content organized by type: Project, Guide, Post, Signature Lines.
  - Git-based workflow for content and code.
  - DNS routed through Cloudflare Tunnel to local app instance.
